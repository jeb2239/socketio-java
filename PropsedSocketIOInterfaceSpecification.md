# Codes #

## Socket State ##

| **Name** | **Code** | **Description** |
|:---------|:---------|:----------------|
| CONNECTING | 0        | A connection attempt has been initiated |
| CONNECTED | 1        | The socket is connected |
| CLOSING  | 2        | The socket is attempting an orderly close |
| CLOSED   | 3        | The socket is closed/disconnected |

## Disconnect Reason ##

| **Name** | **Code** | **Description** |
|:---------|:---------|:----------------|
| CONNECT\_FAILED | 1        | A connection attempt failed. |
| DISCONNECT | 2        | The disconnect method was called, or the connection was lost. |
| TIMEOUT  | 3        | The connection timed out prior to close initiation. |
| CLOSE\_FAILED | 4        | A close attempt failed prior to reaching CLOSE\_SIMPLE state. |
| ERROR    | 5        | Some sort of error occurred that resulted in a disconnect. |
| CLOSED\_REMOTELY | 6        | Disconnected due to a server initiated a close. |
| CLOSED   | 7        | An orderly close completed successfully. |

# Events #

## CONNECT\_EVENT ##

Indicates that the connection has been established.

## DISCONNECT\_EVENT ##

Indicates that the connection was disconnected or failed to connect.

| **Arg** | **Value** |
|:--------|:----------|
| First   | Disconnect Reason |
| Second  | If present is an error message indicating the reason for the disconnect |

## MESSAGE\_EVENT ##

| **Arg** | **Value** |
|:--------|:----------|
| First   | The message type |
| Second  | The message object |
| Third   | If present is the exception thrown by the message parser |

The message event handler will be given 2 or three arguments. the first will be the message type.
If none was specified by the sender then the message type will be 0 (text). The second argument is
the message contents. If there is a message parser registered for the message type then the message
will be the result of the decode if the decode succeeds, or the original message contents if the
parse failed. If the third argument is provided, then it is the exception, that was thrown by the
parser.
